# rusEFI Quick Start

Version 0.01

Congratulations, your fully assembled rusEFI unit has arrived! This document would get you started! Online version is available at https://rusefi.com/s/start

## Tuner Studio

We recommend that you use EFI Analytics Tuner Studio desktop application to tune your rusEFI Engine Control Unit.

Please download and install from https://www.efianalytics.com/TunerStudio/

Lite edition would get the job done, but registered version comes with tons of benefits like search, higher logging rate etc etc.

## Create New Project

Hook up your rusEFI to your desktop with a cable. USB power is sufficient to get your unit running on your bench!

Launch Tuner Studio Beta and hit 'Create New Project'. Pick a name and hit 'Detect' for TunerStudio to download the .ini project template matching for your unit from the Internet.

Tuner Studio would scan through your connections and detect your unit! Hit 'Accept' in the bottom-right corner. Hit 'Next' a few times, hit 'Finish'. You are ready to calibrate your unit!

## Make it yours

rusEFI fuel control strategy needs your actual engine displacement to calculate fuel. A bit later engine make/model/name would be useful so make it yours!

## Tune it

TunerStudio project is the tuning documentation. Please glance over all the available dialogs. Many settings have a blue "?" icon - click on these, those tooltip are the most complete rusEFI documnetation.

## Log it

Any troubleshooting begins with logs. One of rusEFI powers is the amount of data points available for logging!

Shaky videos do not do it. Even high-resolution screen shots do not do it: *it has to be a proper log .mlq file*.

For cranking/idling/trigger troubleshooting setting up maximum data rate is recommended.
