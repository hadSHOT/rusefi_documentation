# I Have an Idea

**Q: I have an amazing ideas, let's do X! I bet it's possible with existing rusEFI software and hardware! Why not start right now**

A: Let me answer this universal question with a universal answer, in two parts:

   1) shortage of available resources (mostly software developers and testers)
   2) how can you help with this proposal or [in general](HOWTO-help-rusEFI)?

**Q: Is it possible to do X?**

A: Moon landing was possible more than 50 years ago! A _lot_ of things are possible with proper resource allocation. If you can engineer it, go for it! If you are asking for help, we offer commercial engineering services. See [Standalone on Demand](Standalone-on-Demand) see [Royalty](Royalty).
