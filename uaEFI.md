## FAQ

Q: Can it do 8x8?

A: You would have to remove two flyback diodes to have 8 similar injector outputs. You would have to figure out a way to have 8 equal coil outputs, maybe settle on wasted spark?

Q: Do you have any dealer prices or discount for companies?

A: There is too little profit margin on these to offer discounts sorry.
PCB files are available for free you should be able to order your own, paid consulting is available on how to set thingsÂ up with JLCPCB if you need help.

Q: How do I use uaEFI with dumb coils?

A: See notes on the schematics, it has part numbers to add and reference numbers to remove!

Q: How do I add bluetooth?

A: See https://github.com/rusefi/rusefi/wiki/Bluetooth#jdy
